# DS/ML Learning 2026 (Industry-Focused)

This repository is my **hands-on roadmap** to build solid **Data Science and Machine Learning** skills throughout 2026 with a strong **industry focus**.

It contains:
- **Practice notebooks** (Python/SQL/Stats/ML)
- **Actionable notes** (checklists, common pitfalls, decision rules)
- **Weekly deliverables** (clean artifacts, short reports)

My main end-to-end portfolio project lives in a separate repo: **`predictive-maintenance-rul`**.

---

## Goal

Become job-ready for an **entry-level** role (Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist / Junior ML) by focusing on:

- Python for data (pandas, NumPy, notebooks)
- SQL and data thinking
- Applied statistics
- Core ML (proper validation, metrics, leakage awareness)
- Industry habits (Git, clean READMEs, reproducibility)

---

## Study System (60/25/15)

Weekly target: **~30 hours/week**

- **60% Practice**: notebooks + mini-projects + portfolio artifacts  
- **25% Courses**: structured learning (IBM Data Science + later add-ons)  
- **15% Reading/Notes/Review**: summaries + Anki + interview prep  

---

## Weekly Work Plan

### Monday–Friday (4h/day)
- **45–60 min**: course content (1–2 lessons max)
- **~2 hours**: hands-on practice (a notebook with a clear objective)
- **45–60 min**: portfolio work (cleanup + README updates + commit)

### Saturday (5–6h)
- Deep work: build features / models / experiments
- 1 hour: documentation (notes + README)

### Sunday (4–5h)
- Consolidation: refactor + organization + interview-style exercises
- 30–60 min: review (Anki)

## Definition of Done (Weekly)

Every week I deliver:

1. ✅ **1 clean notebook** with conclusions (in `/notebooks`)
2. ✅ **1 short weekly report** (in `/reports`)
3. ✅ **Actionable notes** (in `/notes`)
4. ✅ **A meaningful commit history** (work is tracked and reproducible)

## Repository Structure

ds-ml-bootcamp-2026/
├─ notebooks/ # Practice notebooks by topic / week
├─ notes/ # Short, actionable notes (checklists, pitfalls, decision rules)
├─ data/ # Empty (NO large datasets committed)
├─ src/ # Reusable code (helpers, pipelines, utils)
├─ reports/ # Weekly 1-page summaries
├─ assets/ # Images / plots / diagrams for README/reporting
└─ README.md


> ⚠️ Rule: do not upload large or private datasets to GitHub. Commit code and small samples only.

## Naming Conventions

- Notebooks: `YYYY-WW_topic_description.ipynb`  
  Example: `2026-W02_pandas_groupby_basics.ipynb`

- Reports: `YYYY-WW_weekly_report.md`  
  Example: `2026-W02_weekly_report.md`

---

## Notes Format (Recommended)

Each note should be **actionable**:

- **What it is (1 line)**
- **When to use / when NOT to**
- **Common pitfalls**
- **Checklist (5–10 bullets)**
- **Short snippet/pattern**
- **How it applies to Predictive Maintenance**

---

## Courses (Tracking)

Core:
- [ ] IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

Optional / later:
- [ ] Google Data Analytics (light, mobile)
- [ ] Machine Learning Specialization (DeepLearning.AI / Andrew Ng)
- [ ] MLOps / Production ML (later)
- [ ] Cloud certification track (e.g., Azure DP-100 later)

---

## Related Repositories (Portfolio)

- **Main project:** `predictive-maintenance-rul`  
  **Goal:** Predictive Maintenance / RUL prediction using time-based validation, a Random Forest baseline, and a production-minded structure (clean repo, reproducibility, and documentation).

---

## Progress

- **Current week:** W01  
- **Status:** Starting setup + first notebooks
